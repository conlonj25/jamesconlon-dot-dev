## Jamesconlon.dev &nbsp; [Live](https://www.jamesconlon.dev/) &nbsp; [Github](https://github.com/conlonj25/jamesconlon-dot-dev)

This isn't for you. This is for the scholars 100 years from now. Built with Astro, this ships as almost 100% html straight to your browser. If you notice any mistakes, feel free to go to the github and create a PR.

## Miniref.pro &nbsp; [Live](https://www.miniref.pro/)

Fun link-sharing app that runs great on mobile. I did this all in Next JS, using Redis DB. This was my first time using Redis and I was impressed at how flexible it is. This app has way more scope for improvement. The next step is to add personalised subdomains and analytics. I expect Redis to cope pretty well with this too.

## Bookshelf &nbsp; [Github](https://github.com/conlonj25/bookshelf)

Oldie but a goodie. Wrote custom controllers for users, books and orders using Java servlets and JDBC.
It's not live anymore because I'm not maintaining a whole Apache Tomcat server. But if you want to - feel free! It comes as a single deployable .war file. There's also some raw SQL for creating and seeding you database. I didn't think there was any other way!

## Minecraft &nbsp; [Live](https://minecraft-clone-ashy.vercel.app/) &nbsp; [Github](https://github.com/conlonj25/minecraft-clone)

Some might call it... groundbreaking! Pure Javascript (OSG.js)
