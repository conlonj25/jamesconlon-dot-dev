## Nudge &nbsp; [Live](https://nudge-app.com/) &nbsp;

Tiny changes, remarkable results. This is a habit tracker, but built exactly the way I want it. Nudge doesn't care about streaks. It cares about consistency. It's Github-style history lets you track your consistency over days, weeks and years. I'm actively dogfooding this every day so expect it to evolve over time. The most immediate priority is to convert it to a React-native application so it can be run natively on mobile.

T3-Stack, NextJS, Postgres. First time using TRPC to provide a typesafe interface between front and back end. I'm sold!

## Miniref.pro &nbsp; [Live](https://www.miniref.pro/)

Fun link-sharing app that runs great on mobile. I did this all in Next JS, using Redis DB. This was my first time using Redis and I was impressed at how flexible it is. This app has way more scope for improvement. The next step is to add personalised subdomains and analytics. I expect Redis to cope pretty well with this too.

## Jamesconlon.dev &nbsp; [Live](https://www.jamesconlon.dev/) &nbsp; [Github](https://github.com/conlonj25/jamesconlon-dot-dev)

This is for the scholars 100 years from now. Built with Astro, this ships as almost 100% html straight to your browser. If you notice any mistakes, feel free to go to the github and create a PR.

## Minecraft &nbsp; [Live](https://minecraft-clone-ashy.vercel.app/) &nbsp; [Github](https://github.com/conlonj25/minecraft-clone)

Some might call it... groundbreaking! Pure Javascript (OSG.js)

## Bookshelf &nbsp; [Github](https://github.com/conlonj25/bookshelf)

Oldie but a goodie. Wrote custom controllers for users, books and orders using Java servlets and JDBC.
It's not live anymore because I'm not maintaining a whole Apache Tomcat server. But if you want to - feel free! It comes as a single deployable .war file. There's also some raw SQL for creating and seeding you database. I didn't think there was any other way!
